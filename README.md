# vanilla-js-animated-list-squarespace-refactor

An animated list where items rearrange based on the selected category, items fade in/out and translate to their new position in the list. Uses CSS transform/translate for hardware accelleration and vanilla js without any 3rd party dependencies so it can be easily injected into site-builders like Squarespace. This implementation is specific to Squarespace.

The project list is configurable by JSON-ish data (actually editing the const objects in the js). A URL must be defined to use images for the background of the items, and there are config vars in the CSS to adjust animation timing.
